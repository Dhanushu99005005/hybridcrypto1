In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts and
a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher. These deterministic algorithms
are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet, and
confidential communications such as credit card transactions and email.
